# Credit-Risk-Classification

This project aims to develop models for credit risk classification using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to predict the credit risk associated with each borrower and provide insights for risk assessment and decision-making.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis (e.g., lending_data.csv).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis code and steps.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, instructions, and information about the files and directories.
